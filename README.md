# phidget-network-server-docker

This repository contains Docker configuration for a <a href="https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Phidget_Network_Server">Phidget22 Network Server</a> run as a service in a multi-container environment, specifically tailored for <a href="https://www.balena.io/">balena.io</a>. I haven't tested this service as a standalone but if you run it and connect a Phidget you should be able to see the server responding to the attachment on the command line.
